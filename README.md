## Overview
Our main goal is to build a website in which you can drag and drop an image of sports person and it will tell you which sports person that is.<br />
We are restricting our image classification to only five classes<br/>
**Steps:** <br/>
1) TEXT PREPROCESSING
2) VECTORIZATION
3) TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY(TF-IDF)
4) CLASIFICATION ALGORITHMS <br/>

## Local Setup
Clone the repository on your local environment <br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jagruthreddy/Celebrity-Image-Classifier
```
Navigate to the folder <br>
```bash 
cd Celebrity-Image-Classifier
```
USE GOOGLE COLAB(SEE EXTRA FOLDER) OR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK<br>
The . idea directory contains a set of configuration files (. xml) for your project.<br>

## Steps

**Logistic Regression** <br />
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems. Logistic function: 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) normalizes everything to be between 0 and 1.
